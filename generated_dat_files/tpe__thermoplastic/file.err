 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.750   TIME= 01:55:10
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.844   TIME= 01:55:10
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.203   TIME= 01:55:11
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.203   TIME= 01:55:11
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 211302).                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.812   TIME= 01:55:12
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      51.484   TIME= 01:55:39
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     206.562   TIME= 01:57:04
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.
