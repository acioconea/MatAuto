 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.406   TIME= 22:16:51
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.516   TIME= 22:16:51
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.391   TIME= 22:16:53
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.391   TIME= 22:16:53
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 211302).                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.031   TIME= 22:16:54
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      60.141   TIME= 22:17:24
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     231.328   TIME= 22:19:08
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     808.969   TIME= 22:25:02
 Contact element 50680 (real ID 5) status changes abruptly from contact  
 (with target element 51490) -> no-contact.                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     808.969   TIME= 22:25:02
 Contact element 50681 (real ID 5) has too much penetration 3.99026264   
 related to target element 51490.  Please verify the pinball radius.     

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =     817.938   TIME= 22:25:08
 Element 1926 (type = 2, SOLID186) (and maybe other elements) has become 
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first     
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.  

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =     980.766   TIME= 22:26:45

 Contact element 56684 (real ID 9) status changes abruptly from          
 no-contact -> contact (with target element 58583).
