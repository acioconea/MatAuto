 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.125   TIME= 00:01:48
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.234   TIME= 00:01:48
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.422   TIME= 00:01:49
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.422   TIME= 00:01:49
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 211302).                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.984   TIME= 00:01:50
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      69.906   TIME= 00:02:30
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     286.031   TIME= 00:04:32
 Material number 12 (used by element 58988 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     989.750   TIME= 00:11:12
 Contact element 56684 (real ID 9) status changes abruptly from          
 no-contact -> contact (with target element 58583).                      

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =    1046.281   TIME= 00:11:45
 Element 1926 (type = 2, SOLID186) (and maybe other elements) has become 
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first     
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =    1223.969   TIME= 00:13:28
 Contact element 49589 (real ID 5) has too much penetration 4.08168642   
 related to target element 51455.  Please verify the pinball radius.     

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =    1350.375   TIME= 00:14:47
 The data points for contact node 10263 in element 51594 exceed 5000.    
 Please switch to other contact detection options or flip the contact    
 and target surfaces.                                                    

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =    2270.453   TIME= 00:23:22
